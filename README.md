# odin-calculator
This Odin project forced me to create a layout that was symetrical, 
as well as create logic to make the calculator understand what to do
in any possible situation. 

I could probably streamline this down the
line when I have a better understanding of JS and logic for situations
like this. 

I definitely felt less like the computer is smarter than me
and like I was having to dumb things down for the computer on this one.
